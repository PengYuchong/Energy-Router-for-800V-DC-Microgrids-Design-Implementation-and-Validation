# Energy-Router-for-800V-DC-Microgrids-Design-Implementation-and-Validation
This repository provides full open-access resources for a high-efficiency three-port energy router targeting 800V DC microgrid applications. The system enables intelligent power management between photovoltaic (PV) panels (15-25V), energy storage batteries (40-50V), and an 800V DC bus through three key technological advancements.
